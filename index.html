        <p>Ethereal Lands features a completely unique Runescape Classic adventure and story unlike any other.</p>
        <p class="story">
            In the realm of Gielinor, a malignant force is stirring. The malevolent demon general, Del'araz, has
            unleashed his noxious lords upon the land, spreading a virulent plague that darkens the skies and withers
            the earth. With Lumbridge in his sights, Del'araz is amassing a terrifying demonic army, intent on sundering
            the town to ashes to lay the foundations for a dark uprising.
            <br><br>
            If the relentless advance of Del'araz and his legion is not halted, the entire world risks falling into
            chaos, with every corner of Gielinor surrendering under his tyrannical rule. The call to arms rings out
            across the land, beckoning heroes to rise against this encroaching darkness, in a desperate bid to save
            their world from being irrevocably conquered by the forces of evil.

        <h1>NEW MAXIMUM LEVEL</h1>
        <p>Ethereal Lands features a new story, quests, areas, monsters and so much more. To tell this new story, <b>we've reduced the maximum level you can reach to 66</b>. Don't fret! You'll reach maximum level in no time, and we're putting a considerable amount of effort into the development and health of our end-game experience! Maximum level will gradually rise with each major expansion release, with the first expansion set to raise the maximum level to 77.</p>
        <h1>NEW AND EXPANDED AREAS</h1>
        <p>New and expanded areas are coming to Gielinor! Areas are built retaining the Classic touch, careful to not fall into the typical "private server" feel.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A new tutorial island, Kani'ani Island, built from the ground-up. Utilizing almost every single ability offered in Gielinor.</li>
            <li>New and expanded dungeons with threatening challenges and epic rewards!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Tasks make their debut in Ethereal Lands, featuring different systems than the typical "Achievement Diary" with clear paths and character engagement.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Unlock access to powerful training areas, such as Frank's Mine, featuring tons of mining nodes, a mine cart and a furnace! (Seen below)</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>WILDERNESS REBORN</h1>
        <p>The wilderness has had many changes! Notably, it now features two new <b>cities</b>, linked by a deadly, inescapable path between them, known as the <b>Bloodshed Span</b>.<br><br>Along with our wilderness redesign, we've also introduced PvP specific rewards and ranks to achieve.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="slide" id="slide2">
        <h1>GRAVEYARDS</h1>
        <p>Gone are the days of respawning in Lumbridge... at least all the time.<br><br>New to all accessible areas are <b>graveyards</b>, respawn points with possible bank access to get you back into what you were doing quicker!</p>
        <h1>NEW SKILL: HUNTSMAN</h1>
        <p>Very similar to the much-beloved Slayer skill, the Huntsman skill focuses on <i>retrieving items or completing specific tasks</i> instead of simply killing creatures. This system opens up an entire new dynamic that was not previously possible. This lets us restrict content, areas and quests to people who have achieved a certain Huntsman level.<br><br>Rewards for Huntsman bounties, or formally acquisitions, are based on the bounty given. For example, a bounty to collect rat eyes will reward either gold, an experience lamp or several Eye of Newts, based on the player's choice.<br><br>Bounty points are rewarded for fulfilling bounties and can be spent for rewards or tossing away a bounty.</p>
