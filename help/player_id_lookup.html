        <h3 class="query">SELECT id FROM players WHERE LOWER(username) = '$playerUsername'</h3>

        <p class="ooo">The order of operations for this web-query is as follows:</p>
        <h3 class="process">Query the selection from the `players` database table.</h3>
        <div class="arrow-down"></div>
        <h3 class="process">If the entered `playerUsername` field matches `username` in the `players` table, return the
            player's `id`.</h3>
        <div class="arrow-down"></div>
        <h3 class="process">If the entered `playerUsername` field does not match any `username` in the `players` table,
            send an error.</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Looking up a player in the `players` table of the database is a very straightforward process. Enter a
            player's username to find their ID. The username field is insensitive to case. The query only works using
            the following information:</p>
        <ul style="text-align: left;">
            <li>Username (str/text)</li>
            <li>id (int)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The lookup field will work with numbers, letters, underscores and spaces.
        </p>
