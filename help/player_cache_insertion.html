        <h2>The Player Cache (Insertion)</h2>
        <hr>
        <h3 class="query">INSERT INTO player_cache (playerID, `key`, value, type) VALUES ('$playerID', '$key', '$value',
            '$type')</h3>
        <hr>
        <p class="ooo">The order of operations for this web-query is as follows:</p>
        <h3 class="process">Query the insert into the `player_cache` database table.</h3>
        <div class="arrow-down"></div>
        <h3 class="process">If the `key` exists, overwrite `value` data in the row.</h3>
        <div class="arrow-down"></div>
        <h3 class="process">If the `key` does not exist, insert the data into a new row.</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Changing the cache of a player in the `player_cache` database table is fairly simple. The `player_cache`
            table of the database holds various information, such as quest progress, ethereal dungeon progress, etc. The
            table includes the following data:</p>
        <ul style="text-align: left;">
            <li>playerID (int)</li>
            <li>type (int)</li>
            <li>key (str/text)</li>
            <li>value (int)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The `key` portion of our data should usually always be lowercase, and instead of using camelCase, we use '_'
            to denote the next word. There are some cases where old game code may have a key in camelCase. For example,
            if a player is missing an Ethereal Item to claim from an in-game vendor that they've purchased, we can add
            `ethereal_item_1559` as the key. The value for `ethereal_item` keys does not matter as the game only looks
            for the key and not a value, with the <span>player.hasCacheKey()</span> function.
        </p>
        <p>The `type` field for our query is always going to be '0' through the Admin Dashboard web
            interface until it is updated to support other `type` values.</p>
