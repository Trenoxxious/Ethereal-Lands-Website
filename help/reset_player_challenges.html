            key.</h3>
        <div class="arrow-down"></div>
        <h3 class="process">If the `playerID` exists and the `key` exists, remove it.</h3>
        <div class="arrow-down"></div>
        <h3 class="process">From the `etherealsouls` table, set `has_accepted_daily_challenges` to 0.</h3>
        <div class="arrow-down"></div>

        <p>Resetting daily challenges for a player is a process that involves finding all of the appropriate daily
            challenge cache keys and then parsing through data in various tables (listed below) to find and remove
            any information associated with that `playerID` having accepted their daily challenges.</p>
        <ul style="text-align: left;">
            <li>daily_challenges</li>
            <li>player_cache</li>
            <li>etherealsouls</li>
            <li>player_daily_challenges</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We simply input a playerID into the field in which we want to reset the daily challenges for. The queries
            that are created and parsed by the server should find and remove or change all needed data to reset the
            daily challenges for that player.
